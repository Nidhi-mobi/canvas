How to test?

Execution:
- npm install will install all the dependencies
- to run the tests in UI you can run `npm run debug`
- to run the tests headless `npm test`

Test Strategy:

- we are using UI to login
- then we are using APIs to create and delete boards
- we are creating and cleaning up board for each test
